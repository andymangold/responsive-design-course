    <h1>About {{(INSERT YOUR NAME HERE}}'s Dog Walking Service</h1>

<p>
  {{(INSERT YOUR NAME HERE}}'s Dog Walking Service has been in business in Baltimore since 2009. We love dogs of all sizes and shapes, and strive to provide a healthy routine for your furry friends. We treat all the dogs we walk just as we treat our own, and every one of our walkers is trained in animal first-aid should anything go wrong. Your pets are safe with us!

  Referrals are available upon request. If you have any questions or would like to sign your pet up to be walked, please visit our <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>.
